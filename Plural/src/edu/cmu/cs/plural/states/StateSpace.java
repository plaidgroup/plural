	 * The contract for
	 * <code>StateSpace.firstBiggerThanSecond(first, second)</code> is to
	 * return true iff first "contains" second, i.e. second is a substate of
	 * first in the state hierarchy. StateSpace is supposed to represent that
	 * type hierarchy. For example, for a hierarchy where [open, closed] refine
	 * alive and [within, eof] refine open, firstBiggerThanSecond(alive,
	 * open)==true, firstBiggerThanSecond(alive, eof)==true,
	 * firstBiggerThanSecond(closed, closed)==true, firstBiggerThanSecond(open,
	 * closed)==false, firstBiggerThanSecond(within, open)==false. Thus you're
	 * essentially asking, is second at least as precise a state as first.<br>
	 * 
	 * Thus, to find out whether some state s is "inside" a permission p, you
	 * want to compare s to p's "root node", let's call it t, with
	 * firstBiggerThanSecond(t, s).<br>
	 * 
	 * <code>firstBiggerThanSecond</code> (and the <code>StateSpace</code>
	 * class as a whole) is really simple right now: It just treats any state s !=
	 * alive as immediate substate of alive. That's why it's doing this funny
	 * comparison. In a sense this is the approach that your formal system for
	 * the ECOOP paper takes, I think. StateSpace doesn't even know what the set
	 * of allowed states is; thus if you pass in some "bogus" state, say, due to
	 * a typo, that will still be a substate of alive and of itself.<br>
	 * 
	 * I'm planning on fixing this mess when implementing support for state
	 * dimensions, because then StateSpace has to really know the exact state
	 * hierarchy. But (hopefully) the contract for firstBiggerThanSecond
	 * remains.
