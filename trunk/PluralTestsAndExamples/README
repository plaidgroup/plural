Plural Test Files and Examples

These test files are released as part of the Plural project so that you can
have some confidence that your install is working. They also serve as a
series of examples which may help you learn how to use Plural.

The test project is a Java project that will build in Eclipse. Unfortunately,
it requires annotations from the PluralPermissions project (available separately)
in order to build. These projects were separated because of licensing issues.
(We didn't want to require your code to be free software just because it includes
our annotations!) 

In order to run the tests, this project must be placed in a separate workspace
from the Plural workspace, assuming you are building from source. See the
Crystal "Testing Your Analyses" instructions for information on how to run
these tests. Those instructions can be found here:
