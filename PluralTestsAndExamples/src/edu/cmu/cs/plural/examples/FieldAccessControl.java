/**
 * This class demonstrates how to control field accesses with Plural
 * by using dimensions.
 * The class defines two state dimensions, A and B, and two fields, a and b.
 * The invariants make Plural map field a (b) into dimension A (B).
 * (Notice that without the invariants, Plural would currently map both
 * fields into the root state, <i>alive</i>, but it would be better to
 * also have a way of explicitly mapping fields into dimensions for the
 * purpose of just controlling which methods access which fields.
 * This example is inspired by Daniel Popescu.
